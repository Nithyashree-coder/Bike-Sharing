# Bike Sharing Assignment
> Outline a brief description of your project.

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- Features playing role in demand for bikes.
- Description of variables with respect to the bike demands. 

## Conclusions
- The most important features for this problem is temperature, season, weathersit, windspeed, year, month. 
- It is observed that demand exceeds in month 9, month 11, month 12. 
- Temperature is the main factor here as when we add this variable in the model, the R2 score increases rapidly. 
- Holiday is also an important contributing factor as people tend to buy bikes during holidays. 
- Windspeed is also taken into account however it is inversely proportional to the demand. 
- As windspeed increases, demand decreases. 
- As the year increases, the bike demand increases.
